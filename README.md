# Compose It Yourself
A WarioWare DIY-styled editor for music.
For now, this tool is still in a prototype stage; not every feature is available yet.
Here's what is available.

- All four instrument tracks
- Custom instruments
- Shuffle beat
- Tempo changing
- Phrase editing

Here's what I still have yet to do.

- Rhythm track
- Frame tool
- The rest of the instruments (currently 1/3 implemented)
